							<h2>In Conversation With Alice</h2>

								<p>Alice recently spoke with producer and writer <a target="_blank" href="https://allieelwell.com">Allie Elwell</a>,. Here’s an edited transcript of their conversation.</p>

								<h3 style="color:darkgray;">Q1. Alice, you’ve recently been awarded with the Bill Gates Senior Prize. What does this award mean to you?</h3>
								
								<p>Being a member of the Gates community has already been incredibly rewarding, so to be awarded the Bill Gates Sr. Prize is deeply humbling because this prize recognises service. When one becomes a Gate Scholar, the most important commitment we make is to be of service to our local and global communities in the spirit of Bill and Melinda Gates. I am trying to find a way to explain how fragile, vulnerable African states try to negotiate their relationships with powerful countries. Is there a different want that we can understand them better, stories that we can tell to help change perspectives? So to be recognised for ones’ contribution is a wonderful acknowledgement. But most importantly, it is an encouragement to push myself to continue to be of service to others and a reminder of the purpose of research in pursuit of making a positive impact on the world.</p>
 

								<h3 style="color:darkgray;">Q2. You’ve focused your research on the politics post-conflict states and how they interact with the international system, with a particular focus on the African Union (AU). Why were you drawn to this area? What have you observed through your research?</h3>

								<p>It was a natural fit for me for multiple reasons. I’ve always been interested in politics, and how politics work, and my background as a genocide survivor drew me to want to understand how international political systems work, particularly in relation to countries going through conflicts, turmoil and instability. These two perspectives, my historical and intellectual pursuits, have always been a throughline of my work. While I found journalism was a great entry point into investigating these phenomena, I wanted to dive deeper into the material, research and perspectives, which academia has allowed me to do. I love investigating my ideas, pulling together various perspectives and debating them.</p> 

								<p>When I first started doing this research, I felt disempowered. But the deeper I delved into the material,  I found a treasure trove of research work on decolonisation and non-caucasian feminist perspectives, others like me who were interested in deconstructing colonialism, inequality, injustice and neo-liberalism. It gave me hope to find that not only am I not the only one concerned with analysing and working on new methodologies that help connect and empower the ‘Global South’, but that these ideas offer hope for new research, transforming how we study politics and even translating into mainstream policy approaches.</p>  


 
								<h3 style="color:darkgray;">Q3. What has been your favourite part about the Cambridge Experience?</h3>

								<p>My experience at Cambridge, particularly as a Gates Scholar, has been incredibly rewarding. To be in a rich environment of intellectual pursuit where ideas, research and work is valued and given a platform. The calibre of talent is unprecedented, you are constantly interacting with the best and brightest minds of your field, tapping into networks and given opportunities to elevate your work and give weight to your ideas. In addition, the vigorous academic research traditions compel you to demand the best of yourself. It’s a deeply enriching, challenging and motivating experience.</p>  

								
								<h3 style="color:darkgray;">Q4. Before you arrived at Cambridge, you were a Canadian political journalist, working for both English and French news agencies in Canada. What kind of stories were you drawn most to?</h3>

								<p>I’ve always been interested in international politics so when I was in Canada, I always tried to find links between Canadians issues and angles in an international context. I was a New Canadian and like many New Canadians, we retain all kinds of international and diasporic ties that we integrate into our daily lives which help form our understandings and experiences. That’s why after many years of being a journalist, I wanted to go into research. My mentor was running the Canadian Centre for Foreign Policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He wanted to train me on how to analyse Canadan foreign policy in the context of international aid for fragile states. That led me to explore how ethnic communities in Canada position themselves vis-a-vis diasporic politics. I was grateful to be in Canada which, contrary to many other countries in the world because multiculturalism is both accepted and celebrated, offers a perfect place to study the intersection of international politics and local communities.</p>


								<h3 style="color:darkgray;">Q5. You were one of the first women to study at the University of Rwanda’s new School of Journalism. Why did you want to become a journalist?</h3>

								<p>First and foremost, I’ve always been a storyteller. I’ve always believed that it’s through stories, narratives, and in discourse that connects us to our humanity, our sense of place and helps us explain the world. For me especially, coming of age in a society still grappling with the traumas and after effects of genocide, I felt it would be an important contribution to tell my own painful experience and the stories of the people of Rwanda. In addition to being drawn to narrative approaches, journalism also provided me with a platform to chase my curiosity, learn how to investigate complex phenomena and what questions to ask. These skills continue to serve me and my academic work today, which relies a great deal on stories and discourses around African states within the international political paradigm.</p>


								<h3 style="color:darkgray;">Q6. What influence do you think your experience as a journalist has had in your approach to academia?</h3>

								<p>Journalism continues to shape everything I do in Academia. One of my biggest worries starting in academia, was whether my writing would be sophisticated enough. However, I’ve since realised that being able to write clearly and concisely has served me well. I love being able to write and explain my ideas and research in a way that’s accessible. We don’t write just for ourselves, or just for our peers, we write to get our work out there and to inspire others. There’s also a level of curiosity and accountability that journalism really helps to foster. Every sentence in a journalism article is there for a reason: purposeful and considered in your exploration of a topic. It also requires you to be disciplined in your approach, calling on you to remain object and impartial when deconstructing information, which are equally important and needed for good research.</p>


								<h3 style="color:darkgray;">Q7. Where do you hope to take your research next?</h3>

								<p>One of the great challenges of being a curious mind is that you get excited by multiple areas. I’m fundamentally interested in theories and the role of ideas in shaping perspectives on African states. At the moment, I’m particularly drawn to the role technology is playing in the context of my research. Now instead of just looking at the political relations, I am examining how technology may or may not impact these global relationships, issues of artificial intelligence and how it’s contributing or not to issues of peace. For example, I have just published an article on the role of technology in the prevention of atrocities. It’s my hope to delve further into institutional conversations about the role of digitisation with the knowledge that our societies remain fundamentally unequal, whether it involves ethics, research agendas, policy-making, regulatory approaches and institutional environments moving forward.</p>
