								<h2 style="color:#393939;">I research international governance, focusing primarily on issues of peace and security. </h2>
								
								<p style="color:#393939;">I am a scholar. Currently completing a PhD at the University of Cambridge, in the department of Politics and International Studies. I research international governance, focusing primarily on issues of peace and security. Grounded in the cooperation frameworks of the African Union with other international actors, my current research is funded by the Gates Cambridge Trust and the Canada Social Sciences Research Council. My other academic interests include IR Theory, Regional Institutions and Technology governance in the Global South. I also hold a Master’s degree in International Studies at Dalhousie University, where my dissertation focused on international peacebuilding and the question of the sovereignty of post-conflict states.</p>

								<p style="color:#393939;">I am a storyteller. I know the importance and the impact of narrative. When I was 19, I was accepted as one of a handful of women in Rwanda’s first and only school of journalism. I later completed a graduate degree in journalism at Carleton University in Ottawa and went on to work as a reporter and producer for Canada’s major news organizations. I was a member of the Canadian Parliamentary Press, reporting on political news of the day. My work has been published in the Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, iPolitics and others. I remain highly interested in issues of hate speech, misinformation and propaganda.</p>

								<p style="color:#393939;">I am an African feminist and a proudly intersectional one. I believe in the fight for gender equality, in Africa and elsewhere. My work is underpinned by the need to craft new ways of imagining women and to make policies that strive to bring more justice and dignity to us all. </p>
